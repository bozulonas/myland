![Five priests in ceremonial robes](./images/priests.jpg)

*The gods are many, and their demands are great.*

### Class Features

#### Level A: Voice of the Gods

Roll for a god from the [Pantheon](#pantheon), name it, choose 3 Miracles. For each of the god's mandates you directly obey when invoking one of its miracles, get +1 die, up to your level. You may add extra dice to a miracle; for each die added this way, roll on the Divine Disfavor table, starting with a d6 and stepping the die up each time.

#### Level B: Orator, Divine Mandate

**Orator**: In a settlement, your speeches on the gods draw audiences of **(level)d6** people. You can hire a number of these followers equal to your level as hirelings. There is a *level-in-6 chance* one has class levels. All who listened to your oratory will be kind to you and do small, domain-appropriate favors.

**Divine Mandate**: Pick one **Appeasement** from one of your Domains. When you obey it while invoking a miracle, gain an extra die.

#### Level C: Found a Mystery Cult

You start your own mystery cult! Pick **three** of the following **Divergences**. You can pick the same one multiple times.

*   **Broadened Pantheon**: Choose an additional Domain.
*   **Deeper Mysteries**: Learn a new miracle from one of your Domains.
*   **Reinterpretation**: Invert one of your Mandates. Your followers adopt this new interpretation.
*   **Syncretism**: Combine two miracles from different domains into one new miracle. This miracle scales with mandates from both domains.
*   **Divine Calling**: Pick another Appeasement for your Divine Mandate.
*   **Blessed Initiation**: When you hire a follower with class levels, they are a Priest of your domains, with miracles of your choice.

#### Level D: High Priest, +3 Divergences

Your followers are now true cultists. Your pronouncements, so long as they align with your domains' mandates, will be followed to the best of their ability. Your hirelings become fanatics who will follow your commands to the death.

## The Sorcerer

*Sorcerers alter the world through sheer force of will. They wear ridiculous outfits and say things like 'Stones! Heed the words of Ziwilgo!'*

### Prerequisites

**Prerequisite**: Exposure to a lethal dose of chaos radiation (and survive), or be born with it.

### Class Features

#### Level A: Force of Will

To change the world, choose an ability (**Alter**, **Harm** or **Create**) and a number of **Sorcerer Dice (SD)**. SD never deplete. Every time you cast, you will also add **Instability Dice (ID)** to a daily pool which are also rolled. **Doubles, triples and quadruples** will cause you to roll on the Sorcerer Mishap table. ID do not count to the effectiveness of the spell, but can trigger mishaps. ID reset at the beginning of each day.

Your robes have been infused with magic after being worn by you for so long. They are now animated and respond to your commands.

*Range*: **[dice]*50'**; *Target*: **[sum]** items; *Duration*: **[sum]** minutes. In a **[dice]*50'** radius, you can cause small items to fall, flames to flicker and die, doors and windows to open and close, armor to rattle, and other impressive and distracting theatrical effects.

**Illusion**  
*Range*: 50'; *Target*: **[dice]*5'** radius; You create a visual illusion of whatever object or creature you want. It can move as you dictate, but it cannot make any sound or other sensory effect. Illusions can only add, not subtract.

### Undeath Domain

**Mandates:**
- Resurrect great powers
- Oppose those who would keep the dead buried
- Seek out and fulfill the will of the dead
- Slay others so they too can join the ranks of the dead

**Miracles:**

**Reanimate**  
*Range*: touch; *Target*: 1 corpse; *Duration*: sum hours. The target is imbued with false life, and can move as it did in life (though it's restricted by what parts it still has). It has up to dice HD, and you can command up to cleric level*2 HD of undead. Other undead you resurrect act according to their nature, which is usually hungry and hostile to anything alive - including you, probably.

**Speak With Dead**  
*Range*: touch; *Target*: 1 corpse, dead or undead; *Duration*: sum minutes. Animate the targeted corpse's skull and ask it sum/2 (round up) questions. It must answer truthfully, if cryptically. If dice is 2 or greater, you can force an undead to stop all other tasks and answer your questions instead. If dice is 3 or greater, you can issue commands to an undead in addition to asking it questions. If dice is 4 or greater, you can raise the targeted corpse as an undead under your command (as Reanimate) for the duration of the spell.

**Steal Soul**  
*Range*: 50'; *Target*: 1 creature with a soul; *Duration*: instant. Make a ranged attack against the target that deals sum necrotic damage and imprisons a proportional amount of their soul in a vessel on your person. This soul can be interrogated as Speak With Dead.

### Vengeance Domain

**Mandates:**
- Do unto others as they have done unto you
- Keep grudges
- Help others settle their own scores
- Ensure the right person is punished for their crimes

**Miracles:**

**Do Unto**  
*Range*: 100'; *Target*: one creature who has wronged you or someone you know; *Duration*: instant. Make a ranged attack that inflicts a minor petty inconvenience that (among other things) deals d4 damage to the target. For each way in which the inconvenience is ironic, you can upgrade the scale of the inconvenience and the damage die size, up to a maximum of dice times.

**Hunt Down**  
*Range*: n/a; *Target*: one creature who has wronged you or someone you know; *Duration*: instant. You learn one random piece of information about the target that you don't already know.
- 1 die: one physical feature (eye color, hair color, current clothing, etc.)
- 2 die: one mental feature (favorite food, personality trait, current mental state, etc.)
- 3 dice: their name
- 4 dice: their current location

**Compel Confession**  
*Range*: touch; *Target*: one creature; *Duration*: instant. Target confesses to a crime they have committed. For each die, you can ask them one question about it, to get more details. At 2 or more dice, you can specify which crime they confess to, though if they didn't do it they'll just make stuff up and hope it's enough for you.

### Wilds Domain

**Mandates:**
- Oppose the spread of civilization
- Prey upon the weak
- Destroy unnatural things
- Spread life into dead places

**Miracles:**

**Call Fauna**

**Grow Flora**  
*Range*: **[dice]*50'**; *Targets*: **[sum]** plants; *Duration*: instant. Targeted plant life grows to **[dice]+1** times its size. If **[dice]** is greater than 2, you can roughly control the shape that it grows in, and have it grab items and creatures (they must save).

**Shatter**  
*Range*: 100'; *Targets*: mortal-made item, construct, or undead; *Duration*: instant. Deal **[sum]** damage to target in an explosion of shrapnel that shreds other nearby unnatural items and creatures, dealing **[sum/2]** damage. This effect chains up to **[dice]** times.
