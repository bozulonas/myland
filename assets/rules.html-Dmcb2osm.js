Itâ€™s a constant, distracting, and unpleasant maintenance issue.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>The Digging Urge: You are filled with an intense, gnawing urge to dig. You must save or spend hours clawing at the earth. While strangely restful, it&#39;s a compulsive, mad behaviour that overrides all else.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Proper Noun Aphasia: You lose the ability to speak proper nouns (names of people, places, specific things). When you try, only an animalistic growl emerges, making communication a frustrating exercise in circumlocution.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Water Phobia: NotÂ <em>your</em>Â phobia, but water&#39;s phobia ofÂ <em>you</em>. Water refuses to come within armâ€™s reach, making rain avoid you in a perfect circle but rendering drinking and hygiene a significant, frustrating challenge.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Susurrus of Objects: You constantly hear a low whisper of voices from every object around you. Using an object makes its voice louderâ€”lighting a match causes it to scream a death knell. You can only concentrate by plugging your ears with your hands.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Acute Phobia: You develop a sudden, severe, and irrational phobia of a common item or creature that was present when you last took the substance (e.g., steel, dogs, fire, closed doors). When confronted with it, you must save or become panicked.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Malignant Lie: The next lie you tell becomes true in the most twisted and harmful way possible. A simple bluff to a guard that &quot;we&#39;re expected by the captain&quot; might result in the captain appearing, furious that you&#39;re late for your own execution.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Waxen Body: Your body takes on the consistency of soft, warm candle wax. While you can reshape yourself with effort, heat causes you to slowly melt and cold makes you stiff and brittle. Taking a serious injury could cause a limb to just fall off.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Unjointed Limbs: Your arms and legs double in length, each growing an extra, awkward joint. Your movements become strange and spider-like, making fine manipulation difficult and marking you as an unsettling presence.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Withered Limb: One of your limbs suddenly withers and cramps into a useless, gnarled claw. It is dead to you, and any attempt by another to magically heal it causes the withering curse to spread to them instead. (none of the characters know this)</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Obsessive Stalker: The next stranger you meet must save or become obsessed with you. This obsession twists into a need to murder you and keep a grisly trophy of your body. If they succeed, they are cured. If they fail or are killed, the curse leaps to theÂ <em>next</em>Â stranger you meet.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Primal Fear: You are seized by a pure, animal terror so profound you can only scream and run. You will flee until dawn, responding with violence to anyone who tries to stop you. If you are killed in this state, you rise as a banshee.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Soul in a Flame: Your soul is violently shunted into the nearest flame (a torch, a candle, a campfire). As long as that flame burns, you cannot be killed by normal meansâ€”damage that would kill you is transferred to the flame, causing it to shrink. If the flame is extinguished, your soul is snuffed out, and you die instantly. You now have a desperate need to protect your new, fragile phylactery.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Ashen Touch: The touch of another human, even a soft caress from a loved one, becomes lethal.Their skin on yours causes your flesh to wither and instantly flake away into grey ash.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Fugitive Hands: Your hands fall from your wrists and skitter away into the darkness. In seven days, they will return. Bloated to the size of wolves and driven by a hateful intelligence, their only goal is to hunt you down and kill you.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>The Uncanny Replacement: You are replaced by something that looks and acts like you, but is fundamentallyÂ <em>wrong</em>. Everyone, including you, knows it. You can&#39;t trust your own reflection, your own thoughts. You are now a stranger to the world and, most horrifyingly, to yourself.</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Post-Mortem Realization: You have a sudden, clarifying moment of horror: you already died, long before this started. The corpse you&#39;ve been piloting has finally reached its expiration date, and the rot is setting in. You must save each day or your body will crumble to dust, releasing your mind as a mad, tormented wraith.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="combat-danger" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#combat-danger"><span>Combat &amp; Danger</span></a></h2><h3 id="attacks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#attacks"><span>Attacks</span></a></h3><p>Attacks always hit.
