*Reckless academics.*

### Prerequisites

*   1d4 years of study at an institute or apprenticed to a master.
*   Take on student loans: 5g per wizard level per adventure. If you fail to pay, the bursar will come for you.

### Class Features

#### Level A: Study, Memorization, and Writing

**Study**: Spend a week studying an available spellbook: gain its knowledge (a minor ability) and learn one of its spells of your choice. ([Example spellbooks](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/wizard))

**Memorization**: You can cast spells from memory rather than from books. Each memorized spell takes 1 inventory slot. When cast, you retroactively choose what spell it was, then replace it with fatigue. Casting a memorized spell can be done in combat.


#### Level B: Study

**Study** *(as per level A)*.

**Penmanship**: You can combine spellbooks, freeing up inventory slots.

#### Level C: Study

**Study** *(as per level A)*.

#### Level D: Ritualist

**Ritual**: At a suitable site of power, with appropriate trappings and a convincing performance you can conjure any magic effect you dream of. The GM stipulates it's prerequisites, see [here]( https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/11/ritual-elements-in-glog-magic.html?m=1) for a guide.
