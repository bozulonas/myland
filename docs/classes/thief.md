*What's yours is mine, and what's mine is also mine.*

### Class Features

#### Level A: Always Prepared

You may spend any amount of money to buy an Unlabelled Package. When the package is unwrapped, you declare what it contains, as long as the contents comprise the appropriate number of Inventory Slots, don't cost more than you originally paid, and could feasibly be purchased.

#### Level A: Wall Crawler

You can climb as well without climbing gear as most people can with climbing gear. Simple climbs do not require a test. You can attempt impossible climbs.

#### Level B: Lucky

Spend Luck to reroll a d20 test. Gain Luck (up to max 1) whenever you do something especially roguish, or during [carousing](#carousing).

#### Level C: Flashback

Make a test to see how an action you performed in the past impacts the current situation. Take 0-2 fatigue based on how outlandish & roguish the action is (+1 if its outlandish, -1 if its roguish).

#### Level D: Backstab

When striking a vulnerable opponent, your [enhanced](/rules.md#attacks) attack deals 2d12 instead of its normal dice.
