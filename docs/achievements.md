## Memorize Spell
Consume 5g worth of alchemically liquified gemstones and meditate on a spell for 1 day. That spell is now crystalized in your brain and takes 1 inventory slot. When cast retroactively choose which spell it was and clear it from your inventory, but then replace it with fatigue. Casting a crystalized spell takes but a gesture and a phrase, and can be done in combat.

> Flavor: By drinking alchemically liquified gemstones while meditating on spells, you can  crystallize *(literally)* the impossibly complex thoughts. Once mastered in these controlled conditions, the spell can be drawn on almost instinctively, making difficult spells easy to cast very rapidly. This comes at the cost of rigid, erratic personalities and mental illness, as flexible brain function was displaced by more and more spells. *(To say nothing of the tragedy of failed meditations!*). **Wizard Flowers** After death *(whether natural or hastened)*, wizard brains are often boiled away by their successors in order to extract the “wizard flower,” the hardened gemstone, now a branching, coral-like structure—a magical thought in physical form, useful for constructing enchanted items of all sorts. Valuable treasure.
