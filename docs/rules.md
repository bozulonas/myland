# House Rules

## Character Basics

### Attributes

Characters have three attributes: **Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**. These are used to make [saves](#saves). 

### Saves

When attempting something risky, you might be asked to make a **save** against the threat of a consequence. Roll a d20 to represent the threat. If your attribute beats the threat (or matches it), you successfully avoid the consequence. (Put another way, if the threat rolls equal to or under your attribute, you successfully avoid the threat)


## Actions

When making a save you can...

### Leverage Time, Gear and Skill

Describe how you use the available time, gear and/or a relevant skill. This sets the save's [difficulty](#difficulty). If you have all three it's trivial (no roll needed), only two or one it's normal / hard. If you don't have any it's impossible. A skill is something from your character sheet / backstory.

For example if you have a crowbar (gear), but are short on time and skill, a save to avoid a threat while prying open a door may be hard *(limited reward, severe consequences)*. However if you have ample time, gear and skill the save may be trivial *(no roll*).

### Raise the Stakes (aka Devils Bargain)

Describe how you adjust your approach to increase the reward, or gain advantage, at the expense of greater risk.

### Gambit

Instead of an attack you may attempt repel, stop, [impair](#attacks), trip or other similar effect to a foe. Make a save to avoid a repercussion.

## Core Mechanics

### Difficulty

A save can become easier or harder in two ways:

*   **Risk and Reward**: What you stand to gain and lose from a save. As a task becomes easier the reward increases and the risk decreases. A PC can choose to raise the stakes, in which case increase both the risk and reward.
*   **Advantage/Disadvantage**: Roll twice and take the best/worst result.

### Magic

- To cast magic, invest a number of _Mana Dice_ (d6) of your choice, up to the number you have access to. Spells will refer number of [dice] and the [sum]. 
- The way most adventurers cast magic is from using **spell books** they loot.
- **Spell books** take one inventory slot, normally contain one spell and each casting adds fatigue to your inventory. It takes one dungeon turn to cast from one (cannot be done in combat).
- Spells come with one *Mana Dice*, more can be attained from items, ritual or other sources. Rolling doubles causes a [mishap]().

### Time
Time is relative. It flies when you're having fun, and stops during a moment of mortal terror. As such, the tracking of time is suitably abstracted to match:
- 10sec / a round: how long it takes each participant to take an action in combat 
- 10min / a dungeon turn: how long it takes for an action during exploration. One roll on the dungeon clock.
- 1hr: Has elapsesed whenever a 1 is rolled on the dungeon clock.

## Combat & Danger

### Attacks

Attacks always hit. Roll your weapon's die and do that much damage to an opponent, minus their armour.

When an attack is **impaired**, such is firing into cover, or fighting while grappled, roll d4 for damage regardless of weapon. When an attack is **enhanced** by a gambit or vulnerable opponent, roll d12. A **Blast** or **Cleave** attack affects all targets in a specific area.

Instead of an attack you can perform a risky gambit (like tripping or disarming an opponent).

### Hit Protection and damage

Damage is dealt first to a creature's Hit Protection (HP). This represents the creature's ability to avoid or shrug off real damage. Once HP is depleted, damage is dealt to STR.

After taking STR damage, the creature must make a STR save. If they succeed, they are still able to fight. If they fail, they take critical damage.

When a creature takes critical damage, they take an Injured Condition, and are incapacitated until tended to by an ally and take a short rest.

If an incapacitated creature is left untended for 1 hour, they die.

### Healing & Recovery

A moment to catch your breath restores all lost **Hit Protection (HP)**. Recovering lost attribute points requires a full week of uninterrupted rest in a safe place.

### Armor

Subtract your **Armor** value from any incoming damage. The maximum base Armor value is 3. Shields provide +1 Armor but require a free hand.

### Attribute score loss and death

If a creature has their **STR** reduced to zero, they are **dead**. If **DEX** is reduced to zero, they are **unable to move**. If **WIL** is reduced to zero, they are reduced to **insensibility**.

When your character **dies**, roll up a new one. The GM should introduce them as soon as possible. Getting back into the game quickly is more important than realism.

### Conditions

Conditions are negative effects. Each **Condition** must be placed in an inventory slot. 

Some Conditions have additional effects, which apply as long as the Condition remains in your inventory.

Conditions can only be removed by meeting their clear requirement—often a short, long or full rest.

### Deprivation & Fatigue

Lacking essentials like food or rest makes a character **Deprived**. A Deprived character cannot recover HP or attribute points. For each day they remain Deprived, they gain the **Fatigued** condition.

### Morale

NPCs and hirelings must make a **WIL save** to avoid fleeing. This check is triggered after they suffer their first casualty or when their group is reduced to half its original numbers. This rule does not apply to Player Characters.

## Growth & Advancement

### Hirelings

Hirelings are NPCs recruited to join the party. They can be created by rolling their attributes or by choosing a pre-made background that defines their skills and stats.

### Earning XP

Characters gain XP from the valuable treasures and boons they earn during an adventure. XP awards don't need to reflect monetary value; boons or fabled items have intangible worth. Each PC gets the full XP value of each treasure.

| Quality | XP | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Poor | 0 | Bag of silver, used dagger, knucklebone dice |
| Normal | 1 | Bag of gold, gem, fine armor, magic scroll |
| Fabulous | 3 | Magic sword, giant diamond, mithral chainmail |
| Legendary | 10 | The Staff of Ord, a djinni's wish, a dragon hoard |

### Advancement

#### Class Levles
- XP Cost: [new level] x 5 XP
- Attribute increase: roll d20 once for each of your mouse’s STR, DEX and WIL. If a result is higher than the attribute’s current value, increase it by one. 
- Hit Protection Increase: Roll your class's hit points die and add it to your maximum HP
- Talent: Gain any talents listed on your class.

Notes:
- You can can 4 class levels max
- You can mix and match classes
