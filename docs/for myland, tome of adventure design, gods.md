Table 2-54: Physical Form of Planar Traveler
| Die Roll | Physical Form (d100) | Additional Feature (d100) |
|---|---|---|
| 01-05 | Human + unusual skin color | Large eyes or single eye on stalk, whichever fits best with the creature’s physical form. |
| 06-10 | Plant appearance (browse through Table 2-59) | Large head (if bipedal) or some sort of visible brain-type organ if not. |
| 11-15 | Roll again for a result on this table, but add wings | Levitates and probably moves by levitation as well. |
| 16-20 | Serpentine or spiral-shape of mist-like, other-planar substance | Long fingers or fingernails (if bipedal). If not bipedal it uses mental power or magical levitation powers to manipulate objects instead of using actual hands. |
| 21-25 | Ooze or slime (see Table 2-41 for ideas) | Rides monstrous steed if bipedal. If not bipedal, it is carried on a platform or palanquin by unintelligent buglike creatures with whom it communicates mentally. These might be connected to the creature by filaments or tubes. |
| 26-30 | Resembles a normal animal (Table 2-2) with a Demonic Attribute (Table 2-49) | Surrounded by bodyguard minions of a lesser race/type. These need not be planar creatures; they might be assembled from available local humanoids. |

| 46-50 | Pillar of Unusual Material Composition (Table 2-52) | Wears twisty, baroque, complicated jewelry. |
| 51-55 | Resembles a human but with a Demonic Hint (Table 2-47) and also with an attribute of a normal animal (Table 2-2). | Smokes a hookah or pipe (yes, this includes the oozes). |
| 56-60 | Aquatic creature (browse through Table 2-2) + Unusual Material Composition (Table 2-52) | Crawls with small symbiotic creatures that assist it in some way - either as a life support system or servants. |
| 61-65 | Appearance of a normal aquatic creature (browse Table 2-2) | Large eyes or single eye on stalk, whichever fits best with the creature’s physical form. |
| 66-70 | Beast (Table 2-2) + unusual skin color | Large head (if bipedal) or some sort of visible brain-type organ if not. |
| 71-75 | Beast (Table 2-2), body of a different kind of beast (Table 2-2), wings, and a Demonic Attribute (Table 2-49). Make it bipedal unless it has a sinuous body like a centipede or snake. | Levitates and probably moves by levitation as well. |
late objects instead of using actual hands. |
| 81-85 | Human head and torso with tail, beast arms and legs (Table 2-2), wings, and a Demonic Attribute (Table 2-52) | Rides monstrous steed if bipedal. If not bipedal, it is carried on a platform or palanquin by unintelligent buglike creatures with whom it communicates mentally. These might be connected to the creature by filaments or tubes. |
| 86-90 | Human head and torso with tail, beast legs (Table 2-2) | Surrounded by bodyguard minions of a lesser race/type. These need not be planar creatures; they might be assembled from available local humanoids. |
| 91-95 | Human head, beast body (Table 2-2) | Uses staff as weapon if bipedal. If not bipedal, then it wears some sort of harness, garment, attachment or mechanism that carries complex devices. |
| 96-00 | Combination of two animals (Table 2-2) | Very attractive appearance if it has a humanoid form. Otherwise, it speaks by using a mechanism or arcane apparatus. |
Let me know if you need me to look up any of those referenced tables!



Table 2-59: Basic Form of Plant Monster
| Die Roll (d100) | Basic Form (d100) | Specific Type of Form (d100) |
|---|---|---|
| 01–05 | Bamboo | Limbs or body part moves, but the rest of the plant is immobile (rooted). The plant is purely a melee fighter. (Roll on Table 2-74: Limb Attacks) |
| 06–10 | Broad leaves | Limbs or body part moves, but the rest of the plant is immobile. The plant uses a special attack to augment damage from the limbs: roll on Limb Attacks Table (Table 2-74) to get ideas for the limbs, and roll on Table 2-61 to get ideas for the nature of the augmenting attack. |
| 11–15 | Bush or shrub | Limbs or body part moves, but the rest of the plant is immobile. The plant uses a special "pulling" attack to draw prey to the limbs: roll on the Limb Attacks Table (2-74) to get ideas for the limbs, and roll on Table 2-61 to get ideas for the nature of the special pulling attack. |
| 16–20 | Cone | Limbs or a body part of the plant moves (roll on Table 2-74 for ideas), but the rest of the plant is immobile. The plant also has a special "pulling" attack to draw prey towards it, but also has a special attack to augment damage from the limbs. Roll on both columns of Table 2-61 to determine the nature of the pulling and augmenting special attacks. |
| 21–25 | Coral-type growth | The plant is not mobile, but it delivers a poisonous or transformational substance into its near vicinity. Deliveries include fine needles, seeds, smells, spilled seed-pods on the ground, slow-moving ooze, and as a result of falling prey to these substances include things like a similar plant turning into a plant creature controlled by the plant, turning into a seed-carrier for the plant, or just dying to create fertilizer. Keep in mind that creatures killed for fertilizer might also be caused to rot faster than normal after dying. |
| 26–30 | Fern | No part of the plant moves, but it has minimal powers. These powers include the telepathic ability to dampen opponents who nearby to its equipment, or to poison opponents up close. Other possibilities include mental powers that mimic enchantment-type magic—the plant can dominate someone's mind to create an ally (who will later be used to fetch fertilizing carcasses to the plant's roots). |
| 31–35 | Grass-like stalks | The plant is purely a melee fighter, using its movement to slowly make its way into close enough range for hand-to-stalk combat. Roll on the Limb Attacks Table (2-74) to get ideas for how it attacks. |
| 36–40 | Hanging moss | The plant is mobile (see Table 2-60 for ideas about mobility methods). In addition to fighting with mobile limbs (see Table 2-74 Limb Attacks), it has an augmenting attack from Table 2-61. |
| 41–45 | Ivy | The plant is mobile (see Table 2-59 for ideas about mobility methods). In addition to fighting with mobile limbs (see Table 2-74 Limb Attacks), it has a Physical Distance Attack from Table 2-62. |
| 46–50 | Lump | The plant is mobile (see Table 2-60 for ideas about mobility methods). In addition to fighting with mobile limbs (see Table 2-74 Limb Attacks), it has a Pulling Attack (Table 2-61) AND an Augmenting Attack (Table 2-61). |
| 51–55 | Mold | The plant is entirely immobile, but it has a Physical Distance Attack (see Table 2-62). The Physical Distance Attack causes general damage (hit points or equivalent). |
| 56–60 | Mushroom | The plant is mobile (see Table 2-60 for ideas about mobility methods). In addition to fighting with mobile limbs (see Table 2-74 Limb Attacks), it has a Physical Distance Attack from Table 2-62. The Physical Distance Attack causes general damage (hit points or equivalent). |
| 61–65 | Sphere | The plant is mobile (see Table 2-60 for ideas about mobility methods). In addition to fighting with mobile limbs (see Table 2-74 Limb Attacks), it has a Physical Distance Attack (Table 2-61) AND an Augmenting Attack (Table 2-62). The Physical Distance Attack causes general damage (hit points or equivalent). |
| 66–70 | Thorn-bush | The plant is entirely immobile, but it has a Physical Distance Attack (see Table 2-62). The Physical Distance Attack has a Special Effect (Table 2-62). |
| 71–75 | Tree, palm | The plant is mobile (see Table 2-60 for ideas about mobility methods). In addition to fighting with mobile limbs (see Table 2-74 Limb Attacks), it has a Physical Distance Attack from Table 2-62. The Physical Distance Attack causes general damage (hit points or equivalent). |
| 76–80 | Tree, pine | The plant is mobile (see Table 2-60 for ideas about mobility methods). In addition to fighting with mobile limbs (see Limb Attacks Table), it has a Physical Distance Attack (Table 2-62) AND an Augmenting Attack (Table 2-62). The Physical Distance Attack causes general damage (hit points or equivalent). |
| 81–85 | Tree, short | The plant is rooted to the ground, but has a charged or temporary attack. It has mobile limbs (see Table 2-74 Limb Attacks), a pulling attack (Table 2-61), and a Distance Attack with a Special Effect. |
| 86–90 | Tree, tall | The plant moves (Table 2-60) and has a Physical Distance Attack (Table 2-62) with a Special effect. However, it does not have a melee attack of any kind. |
| 91–95 | Underground bulbs | The plant is rooted to the ground. It has one Physical Distance Attack that causes damage (Table 2-62), and it has a second Physical Distance Attack with a special effect (Table 2-62). |
| 96–00 | Vines | The plant is a botanical war machine. It moves (Table 2-60), it has a limb attack (Table 2-74), it has an Augmenting Attack (Table 2-62), it has a Pulling Attack (Table 2-61), it has a Physical Distance Attack, and the Physical Distance Attack has a Special Effect (Table 2-62). Do not trifle with this plant: it will turn you into seeds and fertilizer faster than you can say, "It's just a plant, pass me one of the berries." |
