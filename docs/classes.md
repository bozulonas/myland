Activating a feat in combat incurs 1 fatigue unless its description says otherwise.

#### Defensive Feats

* **Block**: Impair a d6 or d8 attack. This does not incur fatigue if you are wielding a shield.
* **Dodge**: Impair a d8 or d10 attack. This does not incur fatigue if you are equipped with no more than light armor (1 Armor) and a d6 weapon.
* **Parry**: When targeted by a melee attack, roll your weapon's damage die versus the incoming attack's damage die.
    *   **If you roll higher**: You nullify the attack and deal your roll as STR damage to the attacker, bypassing their armor.
    *   **If you roll lower**: You take the attacker's roll as STR damage, bypassing your armor.
    *   **If you tie**: Your weapons clang off each other, and the attack is nullified.
    *   This feat does not incur fatigue.

#### Offensive Feats

* **Power Attack**: Add +1d12 damage to your melee attack. Make a STR test to avoid incurring fatigue.
* **Maneuver**: Add a tactical maneuver (e.g., trip, disarm, push) to your attack. Make two DEX tests. You can use the results as you wish to avoid incurring fatigue and to avoid any negative consequences of the maneuver.
* **Cleave**: Your melee attack affects all targets in a specific area (e.g., all enemies in front of you). This stacks with the cleave property of weapons like the battle axe.
