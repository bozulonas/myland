### Divine Disfavor Table

When you ask for too much, the gods may punish you.

| Roll | Result |
|:---:|:---|
| 1 | A god puts before you a **test of faith**, which you must overcome alone. |
| 2 | Hubris begets ruin. Suffer **disadvantage** on saves for the rest of the session. |
| 3 | You **lose your connection** to your patrons for 24 hours. |
| 4 | Misused divine energy sears your eyes. Go **blind** for a week. |
| 5 | You must perform a rite of penance: a vow of **poverty, silence, or fasting** for a month. |
| 6 | The gods take something of personal, **sentimental value**. |
| 7 | You are wounded by what seems like random chance. Suffer a **grievous injury**. |
| 8 | You are **marked by the gods**. Gain a strange physical mutation. See the [Mutations Tab](#mutations). |
| 9 | You are declared an **enemy of an opposed cult**. Their priests will refuse you, and zealots may hunt you. |
| 10 | You are **cast out**, stripped of your divine powers forever. |
