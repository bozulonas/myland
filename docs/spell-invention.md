# Spell Invention

When you invent a new spell, an adjective, material, and form spring into your mind. Choose two of the words to make a phrase, then assign it to a school of magic to form a spell. The spell's name and school of magic serve as touchstones for the spell. 

Invented spells can do whatever the name implies, but are limited without spellburn [spellburn](link to spellburn in rules section). They start only dealing d6 damage (or equivalent effect), have a range of touch, an momentary duration, and affecting at most one target.

Below are some **example spells** formed in this way.

◆ **Roll**: Terrible, Spirit, Gate. **Spirit Gate** sounds fun. You could assign it to Divination to speak to the dead or Conjuration to summon spirit warriors.

◆ **Roll**: Flaming, Thorn, Aura. **Flaming Aura** sounds fun. You could assign it to Evocation to create a spinning fire shield or Enchantment to make yourself the center of attention
