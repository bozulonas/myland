# Spell Invention

To invent a new spell, 
- An adjective, material, and form spring into your mind *(using the button below)*. 
- Choose two of those words to make a phrase 
- Assign it to a school of magic to form a spell. 
- Add your name as prefix, and write it all down in a spellbook.

The spell's name and school of magic serve as touchstones for the spell *(they establish what it can do)*. 

Invented spells can do whatever the name implies, but are limited without [spellburn](/rules.html#spellburn). They start only dealing d6 damage *(or equivalent effect*), have a range of touch, an momentary Ad, and affecting at most one target. These can be enhanced via [spellburn](/rules.html#spellburn), but this costs STR or WIL, and comes with the risk of [spelling errors](/rules.html#spelling-error). 

## Example
Below are some **example spells** formed in this way.
- **Roll**: Terrible, Spirit, Gate. **Spirit Gate** sounds fun. You could assign it to Divination to speak to the dead or Conjuration to summon spirit warriors.
- **Roll**: Flaming, Thorn, Aura. **Flaming Aura** sounds fun. You could assign it to Evocation to create a spinning fire shield or Enchantment to make yourself the center of attention
